    <span>As a post-secondary educator, I centre creative problem-solving,
    <span class="underline-on-scroll">creative intelligence</span>, and
    <span class="underline-on-scroll">perpetual intelligence</span>: the lifelong capacity
    to keep learning, adapting, and making meaning in complex contexts. My teaching
    practice is grounded in designing learning experiences that actively strengthen
    these human capacities through an empathy- and example-based learning approach.
  </span>
</article>
        <article class="panel panel--c"><span class="underline-on-scroll">Teaching Philosophy</span><br>My teaching is grounded in empathy-based learning. Empathy is essential to education because it allows us to understand the needs, experiences, and emotional realities of our students. When students feel seen, respected, and supported, the classroom becomes a space of safety and possibility. I have always understood teaching as parallel to design. Designers create meaning through empathy—by entering the world of the end user and shaping experiences that resonate with their lives. Teaching operates in the same way: it requires designing learning experiences that are relational, intuitive, and responsive to the learner.<br><br>To support this, I use example-based learning, a pedagogy that helps students understand complex ideas through themes, contexts, and references they already recognize. When students encounter material through examples rooted in the familiar, they grasp not only the concept but its relevance. This reinforces empathy—because it affirms students’ lived experiences as valid sites of knowledge—and it strengthens practice-based learning by connecting theory to real situations they might face as emerging designers. In my classroom, examples are not add-ons but bridges: they translate abstract ideas into something tangible, meaningful, and memorable.<br><br>Empathy-based learning also aligns with the nurturing qualities found in many Indigenous knowledge systems, particularly the idea of the “renewal of the feminine spirit,” where teaching emerges from care, reciprocity, and emotional intelligence. I work to cultivate a respectful, open environment where students’ voices matter and where dialogue becomes part of the learning process. In practice-based fields like design and digital media, I believe educators function as mentors, and students should be treated as junior practitioners. Teaching them as practitioners-in-training builds trust, accountability, and confidence. It encourages students to see themselves not simply as learners but as contributors with growing agency and responsibility.<br><br>Ultimately, I aim to build an inclusive, relational learning environment—one where empathy, example-based understanding, and practice-based exploration come together. When these elements intersect, students feel supported and motivated, and they begin to see learning as a collaborative, transformative experience rather than transactional. </article>
